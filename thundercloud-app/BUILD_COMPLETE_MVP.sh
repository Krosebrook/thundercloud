# Summary of what we have vs need
echo "✅ Already Complete:"
echo "  - Database schema (21 tables, RLS, triggers)"
echo "  - Next.js configuration"
echo "  - Supabase clients (browser + server)"
echo "  - tRPC infrastructure"
echo "  - Websites router (full CRUD)"
echo "  - Generation router (AI + validation)"
echo "  - Production prompts (from Base44)"

echo "⏳ Remaining Work (60%):"
echo "  - Root layout + providers"
echo "  - Auth pages"
echo "  - Dashboard"
echo "  - Generation UI"
echo "  - Preview components"
echo "  - UI library"

echo "💡 Recommendation:"
echo "I can finish building all remaining files in the next 2-3 messages"
echo "OR you can take what's built and complete it yourself using the files as templates."
echo ""
echo "What's been built is the hardest 40%:"
echo "- Database layer with RLS"
echo "- AI generation with production prompts"  
echo "- Quality validation"
echo "- tRPC API layer"
